# Spartacus Subscription Billing Integration

Spartacus' Subscription Billing Integration library helps to monetize your subscription and usage-based services, sell them across channels and touch points, bill them, collect and recognize revenue.

It can be added to the existing Spartacus application by running `ng add @spartacus/subscription-billing`. For more information about Spartacus schematics, visit the [official Spartacus schematics documentation page](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/).
