#### Product variants i18n
- translation namespace `variant` was removed from `@spartacus/assets`. Use namespace `variants` that can be imported with `productVariantsTranslations` and `productVariantsTranslationChunksConfig` from `@spartacus/product/variants/assets` instead. Translation keys from this namespace did not changed.

#### Product variants endpoint scope
- scope `variants` was removed from `defaultOccProductConfig`. It's now provided by `ProductVariantsOccModule` under `@spartacus/product/variants/occ` instead. Additionally the endpoint now uses `orgProducts` API instead of `products`.

#### Product variants styles
- styles for `cx-product-variants` were removed from `@spartacus/styles`. Use `@spartacus/product/variants` import instead.

### Feature keys for product configurators

The feature keys that are used to lazily load the product configurator libraries in app.module.ts were available as `rulebased` and `productConfiguratorRulebased` from 3.1 onwards (respective `textfield` and `productConfiguratorTextfield` for the textfield template configurator).

In 4.0, only the longer versions `productConfiguratorRulebased` and `productConfiguratorTextfield` are possible.

Example: A configuration

```
      featureModules: {
        rulebased: {
          module: () => import('@spartacus/product-configurator/rulebased').then(
          (m) => m.RulebasedConfiguratorModule
        ),
        },
      }
```

needs to look like that in 4.0

```
      featureModules: {
        productConfiguratorRulebased: {
          module: () => import('@spartacus/product-configurator/rulebased').then(
          (m) => m.RulebasedConfiguratorModule
        ),
        },
      }
```

### Translations (i18n) changed

- Key `asm.standardSessionInProgress` was removed.

### Storage Sync mechanism

I version 4.0 we removed deprecated in version 3.0 storage sync mechanism. In previous major release we provided more powerful mechanism based on `StatePersistenceService` which can cover all use cases for synchronizing data to and from browser storage (eg. `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) better than the removed storage sync.

What was removed:

- core of the mechanism (reducer)
- configuration (`storageSync` from `StateConfig`)
- default config and default keys (`defaultStateConfig`, `DEFAULT_LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY` and `DEFAULT_SESSION_STORAGE_KEY`)
