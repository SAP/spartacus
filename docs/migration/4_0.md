# Technical Changes in Spartacus 4.0

## Breaking Changes Introduced in 4.0

`ConfiguratorAttributeCheckboxListComponent` now also requires `ConfiguratorAttributeQuantityService`.
`ConfiguratorAttributeDropDownComponent` now also requires `ConfiguratorAttributeQuantityService`.
`ConfiguratorAttributeRadiButtonComponent` now also requires `ConfiguratorAttributeQuantityService`.
`ConfiguratorCartEntryInfoComponent` now also requires `CommonConfiguratorUtilsService`.
`ConfiguratorStorefrontUtilsService` now also requires `KeyboardFocusService`.

### Translations (i18n) changed

- Key `asm.standardSessionInProgress` was removed.

## Storage Sync mechanism

I version 4.0 we removed deprecated in version 3.0 storage sync mechanism. In previous major release we provided more powerful mechanism based on `StatePersistenceService` which can cover all use cases for synchronizing data to and from browser storage (eg. `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) better than the removed storage sync.

What was removed:

- core of the mechanism (reducer)
- configuration (`storageSync` from `StateConfig`)
- default config and default keys (`defaultStateConfig`, `DEFAULT_LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY` and `DEFAULT_SESSION_STORAGE_KEY`)
