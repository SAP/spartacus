# Updating to Spartacus 2.0

## Breaking changes introduced in 2.0

**Storage sync mechanism change in multi cart**

Storage synchronization mechanism previously used to persist active cart id had some limitations that caused bugs on multi site stores (issue: [https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215)).
Default storage sync configuration was removed from `MultiCartStoreModule`. Instead state persistence mechanism have been added for multi cart to provide the same behavior and to support multi site stores. It is build on top of `StatePersistenceService`. This is a new and recommended way to synchronize state to browser storage. Head to docs (TODO: add link to state persistence doc when it will be published) for more information.

**Config Validation mechanism is now a separate module**

Previously config validator logic was part of `ConfigModule`. If you are not using `StorefrontFoundationModule` or any of its descendants, it's required to import `ConfigValidatorModule.forRoot()` in order to make config validators run.

**CartSelectors removed**

We are dropping `cart` store feature along with it's selectors. Instead we recommend working with `ActiveCartService` which uses under the hood new `multi-cart` store feature. It allows us to support more carts (eg. wishlist, saved carts).

**Typed payloads in ngrx actions**

To avoid one type of bugs (missing parameters) when dispatching ngrx actions we added types to their payload. We want to be sure that we always have all required parameters. Additionally with types creating new actions is easier, as you get better editor support when specifying payload.

List of actions with changed payload type: `CartAddEntry`, `CartAddEntrySuccess`, `CartRemoveEntry`, `CartRemoveEntrySuccess`, `CartUpdateEntry`, `CartUpdateEntrySuccess`, `AddEmailToCartSuccess`, `MergeCartSuccess`.

### Deprecated since 1.2

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess() | CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload) | The `ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess` action requires payload. `CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload: { userId: string; cartId: string })` |
| `ANONYMOUS_USERID` | `OCC_USER_ID_ANONYMOUS` | OCC constants are now available under `OCC` prefix to make it more clear that these variables are related to `OCC`.
| AddressBookComponentService.addUserAddress(userAddressService: UserAddressService) | AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService) | The constructor now uses also CheckoutDeliveryService. `AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService: UserAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService: CheckoutDeliveryService)` |
| CheckoutGuard(router: Router, config: CheckoutConfig, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService) | CheckoutGuard(router, routingConfigService, checkoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService, cartService) | The constructor now uses new dependencies. `CheckoutGuard(router: Router, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService, checkoutConfigService: CheckoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService: ExpressCheckoutService, cartService: ActiveCartService)` |

### Deprecated since 1.3

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| PageMetaResolver.resolve() | Use individual resolvers | The caller `PageMetaService` service is improved to expect all individual resolvers instead, so that the code is easier extensible. |
| `initSiteContextRoutesHandler`, `siteContextParamsProviders` | - | the constants were not meant to be exported in public API |
| `inititializeContext`, `contextServiceProviders` | - | the constants were not meant to be exported in public API |

### Deprecated since 1.4

| API                               | Replacement | Notes                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| config `i18n.backend.crossDomain` | -           | it's not needed anymore since using Angular HttpClient for loading i18n assets |
| `CartService` removed | Use `ActiveCartService` instead | `ActiveCartService` have exactly the same name, arguments and return type for most of the methods from `CartService`. Two methods are not present in `ActiveCartService`. Method `getCartMergeComplete` was removed on purpose. Cart merging is an implementation detail of OCC and we don't consider that information useful. Instead you can rely on `getLoaded` method that will correctly present state of the cart. During cart merge it will emit `false` values. Rule of thumb is to only dispatch cart modifications (eg. addEntry, addEmail) when `getLoaded` emits `true`. Method `addVoucher` is also not available in `ActiveCartService`. Instead use `CartVoucherService.addVoucher` method. |
| `CartDataService` removed | Use methods from `ActiveCartService` and `AuthService` | Our libraries are generally moving towards reactive programming and observables. `CartDataService` used completely different patterns and it was hard to follow if data there was already updated or represented previous cart state. Replacements for `CartDataService` properties: `userId` -> replace usage with `AuthService.getOccUserId()`, `cart` -> replace usage with `ActiveCartService.getActive()`, `cartId` -> replace usage with `ActiveCartService.getActiveCartId()`, `isGuestCart` -> replace usage with `ActiveCartService.isGuestCart()`. Property `hasCart` doesn't have direct replacement. Instead you can look into `ActiveCartService.getActive()` method output to see if it emitted empty object (which means that there is no cart). |

### Deprecated since 1.5

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| WishlistEffects, CartEffects, CartVoucherEffects, CartEntryEffects, effects | Create your own effects in separate class and take into account default behavior from effects | We didn't plan to export effects in the first place. Cart effects in public API were a mistake. If you extended this class, you should move your effects to separate class and keep in mind that default effects will be working. |
| getReducers, reducerToken, reducerProvider, clearCartState, metaReducers, clearMultiCartState, multiCartMetaReducers, multiCartReducerToken, getMultiCartReducers, multiCartReducerProvider | Extend cart behavior in higher level (facade) or use custom actions for your specific use case | We didn't plan to export reducers and utilities for reducers in the first place. Cart reducers in public API were a mistake. Any changes to reducers should be handled in different layer (facade) or separate store module. Keep in mind that default reducer behavior will be working under the hood.|
| `CartDetailsComponent.getAllPromotionsForCart` method removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `OrderDetailItemsComponent.getConsignmentProducts` method removed | Use `OrderConsignedEntriesComponent` instead | This functionality has been extracted into separate component. |   
| `CartItemComponent.potentialProductPromotions` input removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `CartItemListComponent.potentialProductPromotions` input removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `OrderDetailItemsComponent.potentialProductPromotions` input removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
| `CartItemListComponent.getPotentialProductPromotionsForItem` method removed | Use `PromotionService` | `PromotionService` is now the main promotion data source. Whenever you need promotions information you should use this service. |
