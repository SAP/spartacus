# Updating to Spartacus 2.0

## Breaking changes introduced in 2.0

**Storage sync mechanism change in multi cart**

Storage synchronization mechanism previously used to persist active cart id had some limitations that caused bugs on multi site stores (issue: [https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/issues/6215)).
Default storage sync configuration was removed from `MultiCartStoreModule`. Instead state persistence mechanism have been added for multi cart to provide the same behavior and to support multi site stores. It is build on top of `StatePersistenceService`. This is a new and recommended way to synchronize state to browser storage. Head to docs (TODO: add link to state persistence doc when it will be published) for more information.

### Deprecated since 1.2

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess() | CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload) | The `ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess` action requires payload. `CheckoutActions.ClearCheckoutDeliveryModeSuccess(payload: { userId: string; cartId: string })` |
| AddressBookComponentService.addUserAddress(userAddressService: UserAddressService) | AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService) | The constructor now uses also CheckoutDeliveryService. `AddressBookComponentService(userAddressService: UserAddressService, checkoutDeliveryService: CheckoutDeliveryService)` |
| CheckoutGuard(router: Router, config: CheckoutConfig, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService) | CheckoutGuard(router, routingConfigService, checkoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService, cartService) | The constructor now uses new dependencies. `CheckoutGuard(router: Router, routingConfigService: RoutingConfigService, checkoutConfigService: CheckoutConfigService, expressCheckoutService: ExpressCheckoutService, cartService: ActiveCartService)` |

### Deprecated since 1.3

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| PageMetaResolver.resolve() | Use individual resolvers | The caller `PageMetaService` service is improved to expect all individual resolvers instead, so that the code is easier extensible. |
| `initSiteContextRoutesHandler`, `siteContextParamsProviders` | - | the constants were not meant to be exported in public API |

### Deprecated since 1.4

...

### Deprecated since 1.5

|  API  | Replacement |  Notes  |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| WishlistEffects, CartEffects, CartVoucherEffects, CartEntryEffects, effects | Create your own effects in separate class and take into account default behavior from effects | We didn't plan to export effects in the first place. Cart effects in public API were a mistake. If you extended this class, you should move your effects to separate class and keep in mind that default effects will be working. |
| getReducers, reducerToken, reducerProvider, clearCartState, metaReducers, clearMultiCartState, multiCartMetaReducers, multiCartReducerToken, getMultiCartReducers, multiCartReducerProvider | Extend cart behavior in higher level (facade) or use custom actions for your specific use case | We didn't plan to export reducers and utilities for reducers in the first place. Cart reducers in public API were a mistake. Any changes to reducers should be handled in different layer (facade) or separate store module. Keep in mind that default reducer behavior will be working under the hood.

## Automated migrations for Version 2

- `CheckoutPaymentService` no longer uses `CartDataService`. This service usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `ActiveCartService` (and `AuthService`). These services needs to be provided for `CheckoutPaymentService`
- `CheckoutDeliveryService` no longer uses `CartDataService`. This service usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `ActiveCartService` (and `AuthService`). These services needs to be provided for `CheckoutDeliveryService`
- `CheckoutGuard` no longer uses `CheckoutConfig`. This config usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `CheckoutConfigService`, `ExpressCheckoutService`, `ActiveCartService`. These services needs to be provided for `CheckoutGuard`
- `AddressBookComponentService` uses now `CheckoutDeliveryService`. This service needs to be provided for `AddressBookComponentService`
- `PromotionService` no longer uses `CartService`. This service usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `ActiveCartService`. This service needs to be provided for `PromotionService`.
- `CheckoutLoginComponent` no longer uses `CartService`. This service usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `ActiveCartService`. This service needs to be provided for `CheckoutLoginComponent`.
- `CheckoutDetailsService` no longer uses `CartService`. This service usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `ActiveCartService`. This service needs to be provided for `CheckoutDetailsService`.
- `NotCheckoutAuthGuard` no longer uses `CartService`. This service usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `ActiveCartService`. This service needs to be provided for `NotCheckoutAuthGuard`.
- `ShippingAddressComponent` no longer uses `CartService`. This service usage was replaced with corresponding methods from `ActiveCartService`. This service needs to be provided for `ShippingAddressComponent`.
