# Technical Changes in Spartacus 5.0

## Breaking changes in product-configurator library

### Reduced number of page header slots and introduction of exit button

In case the rulebased product configurator is launched from product details, product catalog, or cart, the number of slots displayed in
the page header has been reduced compared to 4.0. We only show slots `SiteLogo`,`VariantConfigOverviewExitButton` and `MiniCart`.
For details see `CpqConfiguratorLayoutModule`, `VariantConfiguratorInteractiveLayoutModule` and `VariantConfiguratorOverviewLayoutModule`.
These modules are new in 5.0. The layout configuration was removed from `CpqConfiguratorInteractiveModule`, `VariantConfiguratorInteractiveModule`
and `VariantConfiguratorOverviewModule`.

Note that `VariantConfigOverviewExitButton` is new, and allows to leave the configuration. Clicking it directs the user to the product detail
page, configuration changes are not taken over to the cart.

### Specific page header slots in case configurator is launched in displayOnly mode

In case the rulebased product configurator is launched from the checkout review order page, from the order confirmation page or from the order
history page, the page header shows the standard Spartacus header slots (not the reduced set of header slots listed in the previous section).
Specifically, `VariantConfigOverviewExitButton` is not offered then.
For details, see `CpqConfiguratorPageLayoutHandler` and `VariantConfiguratorPageLayoutHandler`.
The page header slots used in case of the displayOnly mode can be configured in `CpqConfiguratorLayoutModule` and `VariantConfiguratorOverviewLayoutModule`,
under the section `headerDisplayOnly`.

### ConfiguratorCommonsService

The method `removeObsoleteProductBoundConfiguration` has been removed, as it's no longer needed. An obsolete product bound configuration is handled
within action `RemoveCartBoundConfigurations`. So in case you called `removeObsoleteProductBoundConfiguration` before, consider to raise that action, which will
clear all cart bound configurations, and in addition delete the obsolete product bound configuration that is predecessor of a cart bound configuration.

### ConfiguratorGroupTitleComponent

The member `configuration$` was not used and has been removed. In case you use it in a sub component, consider to declare it there via
`configuration$: Observable<Configurator.Configuration> = this.configRouterExtractorService .extractRouterData() .pipe( switchMap((routerData) => this.configuratorCommonsService.getConfiguration(routerData.owner) ) );`

### RulebasedConfiguratorEventListener

This service has been removed. It was responsible for deleting cart bound configurations when an order was submitted. This is now handled by `ConfiguratorRouterListener`, which checks on cart bound
configurations on every navigation that is not configurator related, and deletes cart bound configurations if needed.
