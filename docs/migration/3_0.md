# Technical Changes in Spartacus 3.0

## Breaking Changes

### Translations (i18n) changed
- fixed the typo in the key `user.register.managementInMyAccount` (previously ...`managmentInMyAccount`)

### Default Router options changed
The Angular router can be initialized with so-called `ExtraOptions` in the `forRoot` method fo the `RouterModule`. See https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions for more information on those options. 

The default `ExtraOptions` have changed with 3.0. Before 3.0, Spartacus set the `anchorScrolling` and `scrollPositionRestoration` options. In Spartacus 3.0, the `scrollPositionRestoration` has dropped, and the `relativeLinkResolution` and `initialNavigation` has been added. See the below table for the actual values and reasoning

| Option | < 3.0 | > 3.0
| --- | --- |  --- 
| `anchorScrolling` | `'enabled'` | `'enabled'`
| `scrollPositionRestoration` | `'enabled'` | (removed)
| `relativeLinkResolution` | n/a | `'corrected'`
| `initialNavigation` | n/a | `'enabled'`
| | |

The enabled `scrollPositionRestoration` was causing a bad experience in most cases, as it would scroll the page to the top on each route change. This is unexpected in a single page experience. 

The corrected `relativeLinkResolution` is used to opt-in to [a fix](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/37355) that has been added in angular. This will become default from angular 11 onwards. 

The enabled `initialNavigation` provides better experience with server side rendering, starting initial navigation before the root component is created and blocking bootstrap until the initial navigation is complete. More details available in  [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/api/router/InitialNavigation).

The `RouterModule.forRoot()` method can actually only be called _once_ in an angular application. This makes the default options rather opinionated, which is why the default configurations are carefully selected in Spartacus. The options that have been added/removed can be provided in your custom application with the Angular `ROUTER_CONFIGURATION` injection token. For example: 

```typescript
providers: [
    {
        provide: ROUTER_CONFIGURATION,
        useValue: {
        scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled'
        }
    }
]
```

There's no automation (schematics) planned for this change. 

### Page Layout
With version 2.1 we've started to add the page layout based style class to the root element of the application (`cx-storefront`). This is done in addition to the style class added by the `PageLayoutComponent`. The style class on the `PageLayoutComponent` was considered to be too limited, as it would not affect selectors outside the page template component. 

The implementation of the page layout based style class has moved from the `PageLayoutComponent` to the `PageTemplateDirective`. This results in a cleaner `PageLayoutComponent` with a constructor that no longer requires the lower level `renderer2` service and `ElementRef`. The constructor reduces to the following signature: 
```ts
constructor(protected pageLayoutService: PageLayoutService) {}
```

We've also made the `PageLayoutService` a _protected_ argument, so that it is extensible. 

There's no automation (schematics) planned to migrate constructors automatically. 

### ContentPageMetaResolver
`ContentPageMetaResolver` has a new required constructor dependency `RoutingPageMetaResolver`.

### HttpClientModule is not imported in feature libraries
 
In most cases **HttpClientModule** should only be imported in the root app module, as importing it in lazy-loaded modules can
cause unexpected side effects regarding the visibility of HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, etc. To fix this, we removed all **HttpClientModule** imports from all our
feature libraries and moved them to recipes. 

There's no automation (schematics) planned for this change. 
    
### CmsComponentsService
Method `CmsComponentsService.getChildRoutes` changed return type from `Route[]` to `CmsComponentChildRoutesConfig`

### Config cmsComponents
The property `childRoutes` of config `cmsComponents` changed type from `Route[]` to `Route[] | CmsComponentChildRoutesConfig`.

### PageMetaService lazy-loading related changes

- Protected method `PageMetaService.getMetaResolver` changed its return type from `PageMateResolver` to `Observable<PageMetaResolver>` so it can take into account page meta resolvers from lazy loaded features. 
- PageMetaService's constructor is now using `UnifiedInjector` instead of injecting `PageMetaResolver` token directly.  

### ConverterService lazy-loading related changes

- ConverterService constructor is now using `UnifiedInjector` instead of standard `Injector` 

### Property renamed in `SearchConfig` interface

| Old Name | New Name 
| --- | --- 
| `sortCode` | `sort` 


### OutletRefDirective unregisters template on destroy
The directive's template in unregistered from outlet on directive destroy.

Before v3.0, when an instance of `OutletRefDirective` was destroyed (removed from DOM), its template remained registered for the Outlet, which could cause the same template being rendered multiple times in case of re-creation of the same `[cxOutletRef]` later on. Now it's fixed.

### CartItemComponent lost members
`CartItemComponent` lost members: 
- `@Output()` `view` - instead use `[cxModal]` directive to close modal on link click
- `viewItem()` - instead use `[cxModal]` directive to close modal on link click

### CartItemListComponent
There can be more than one cart entry with the same product code. So now they are referenced by the property `entryNumber` instead of the product code in `CartItemListComponent`.

### AddedToCartDialogComponent lost members
`AddedToCartDialogComponent` lost members: 
- `increment` - use new `numberOfEntriesBeforeAdd` instead
- `cartEntry$` - use `activeCartService.getLastEntry(productCode)` instead

### The type of BaseSiteService is changed
Before it is:
- `BaseSiteService implements SiteContext<string>`
  
Now it is:
- `BaseSiteService implements SiteContext<BaseSite>`

The return type of the function `getAll()` is changed from:
- `getAll(): Observable<string[]>` 

to:
- `getAll(): Observable<BaseSite[]>`


### CmsComponentsService's constructor has an additional parameter added
Before it is:
```ts
  constructor(
    protected config: CmsConfig,
    @Inject(PLATFORM_ID) protected platformId: Object
  ) {}
```

Now it is:
```ts
  constructor(
    protected config: CmsConfig,
    @Inject(PLATFORM_ID) protected platformId: Object,
    protected featureModules?: FeatureModulesService
  ) {}
```
